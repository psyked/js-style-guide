If your variables and function names are descriptive enough, **you shouldn't need comments** in your code to describe how
anything works. However, there's always that *one weird issue.* And for that issue, our recommendations are:

- Single line above the code that is subject
- Multiline is good
- End of line comments are prohibited!
- JSDoc style is good, but requires a significant time investment
